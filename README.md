# 2D-World-Exploration-Game
## Designed and implemented a 2D tile-based world exploration software into an interactive game
#### Rendered a 2D game world using 2D array of simple graphic models as tiles
#### Developed a custom pseudo-random world generation algorithm for seeded level generation
#### Utilizaed persistence and serialization for saving and loading game data
#### Implemented A* search algorithm for targeted path finding among enemy units
#### Developed a CLI and keyboard input recognition software to control character and navigate menus
