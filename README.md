# 2D-World-Exploration-Game
## Designed and implemented a 2D tile-based world exploration software into an interactive game

## Features:
- A 2D game world rendered by using an array of simple graphic models as tiles
- A custom pseudo-random world generation algorithm for seeded level generation
- Persistence and serialization for saving and loading game data
- An A* search algorithm for targeted path finding among enemy units towards the player
- A CLI and keyboard input recognition software to control character and navigate menus
